Yo!

I'm a Free and Open-Source developer currently living in Oslo, Norway and go
by the nickname Foxboron on most platforms.

My interests are mainly in software development, but I dabble around security
related topics such as system hardening, supply chain security and distribution
security. On the non-IT side of things I enjoy travel, Belgian beer, guitars and
photography.

I have contributed to a several Open-Source projects, such as the [Reproducible
Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/),
[Hylang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy), The Tor project, and most notably
the Linux distribution [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#Foxboron) where I do packaging and participate in the security team.

These days I work as a developer in an IT security company.
