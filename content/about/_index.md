Yo!

I'm a Free and Open-Source developer from Bergen, Norway. I have a Master's degree in Information
Science from the University of Bergen, where I wrote about using transparency
logs to secure [Debian rebuilders](http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/20411).

I have contributed to a numerous projects, such as the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/),
[Hylang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy), The Tor project, and most notably the Linux distribution Arch Linux.

These days I work as a developer in an IT security company.
