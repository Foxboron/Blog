Yo!

I'm a Free and Open-Source developer from Norway. Master degree in Information
Science from the University of Bergen, where I wrote about using transparency
logs to secure [Debian rebuilders](http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/20411).

These days I work as a developer in an IT security company.

I have contributed to a numerous projects, such as Reproducible Builds, Hylang,
The Tor project, and most notably the Linux distribution Arch Linux.
